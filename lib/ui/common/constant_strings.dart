I’m a passionate Flutter developer who loves building responsive and performant cross-platform apps. I enjoy crafting user-friendly experiences and writing clean, maintainable code. My portfolio reflects my commitment to quality, minimalism, and creativity.

Whether it's a mobile app, a tablet experience, or a polished web view — I strive for pixel-perfect interfaces and efficient architectures using modern tools like Bloc and modular design patterns.

In addition to coding, I enjoy open-source contributions, design system thinking, and pushing the boundaries of what Flutter can do across devices.''';
